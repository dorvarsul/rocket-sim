# --- Rocket Design: Example Falcon 9-like First Stage ---
# This file defines the physical properties and initial conditions of the rocket
# for the simulation. You can create multiple such files for different rocket designs.

# Masses (in kg)
mass:
  initial: 549054.0 # Total mass of the rocket at launch, including propellant.
  dry: 22200.0      # Mass of the rocket structure only (after all propellant is burned and ejected).

# Engine Parameters
engine:
  thrust_N: 7620000.0 # Total thrust produced by the engine(s) in Newtons (N).
                      # Example: 7600 kN for Falcon 9 first stage.
  burn_time_s: 162.0  # Duration for which the engine fires in seconds.
                      # Propellant is consumed over this period.

# Aerodynamic Parameters
aerodynamics:
  drag_coefficient: 0.4 # Dimensionless coefficient representing aerodynamic drag.
                        # Varies based on rocket shape and Mach number. This is a simplified constant.
  cross_sectional_area_m2: 10.75 # The effective cross-sectional area exposed to airflow in square meters (m^2).
                                 # For a cylindrical rocket, this is pi * (radius)^2.
                                 # Example: For Falcon 9 diameter of 3.7m, radius=1.85m -> pi*(1.85)^2 approx 10.75 m2.

# Initial State
# Defines the rocket's state at the very beginning of the simulation (time = 0).
initial_state:
  position_m: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] # Initial position in meters [X, Y, Z].
                              # [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] typically represents the launch pad at ground level.
  initial_speed_ms: 0.0       # Initial scalar speed of the rocket in meters per second (m/s).
                              # 0.0 means it starts from rest.
  # Initial direction of thrust (normalized vector)
  # This vector determines the initial orientation of the rocket and the direction
  # in which thrust is applied throughout the burn.
  # The simulation will normalize this vector, so its magnitude doesn't matter, only direction.
  #
  # Examples:
  #   [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]          :  Straight vertical launch (default)
  #   [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]          :  Horizontal launch along the positive X-axis
  #   [0.70710678, 0.0, 0.70710678] : Approximately 45 degrees in the X-Z plane (1/sqrt(2) for unit vector)
  #   [0.0, -0.5, 0.866]       :  A specific direction in Y-Z plane (note: will be normalized)
  initial_direction_vector: [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] # Set your desired initial thrust direction here
